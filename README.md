## getHolidaysInYear(year)

- `date` - a `Date` instance set to the day when the holiday is observed
- `name` - the English name of the holiday
- `namePL` - the Polish name of the holiday

## isHoliday(date)

Accepts a valid `Date` object or a valid ISO8601 date string. Returns `true` if there is a public holiday on the given date, and `false` if there is not.

## getHolidayOnDate(date)

Accepts a valid `Date` object or a valid ISO8601 date string. Returns an object with information about the holiday if there is a public holiday on the given date, and `undefined` if there is not. The object will have the same properties as the ones in the array returned by `getHolidaysInYear`.
